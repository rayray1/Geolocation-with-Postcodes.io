## Discussion

I used the following technologies: HTML, Javascript, with GoogleMaps/Postcode.io Api's.
I used [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) which is a Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js to get requests from [Postcodes.io](http://postcodes.io/).

The web page generates a map based on the user's location showing their nearest UK Postcode and Parliamentary Constituency.

The map also prompts the user for their location using Google's Autocomplete search.
